# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
The purpose of creating a daily scheduler through the browser is to not only demonstrate my skills and knowledge on JavaScript to construct the application, but to help users plan out the tasks they need to complete for the current day, for each specific time block. This application was created with creating files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The content of the page has text block areas for each time that corresponds to current hour, and a save button adjacent to the text block areas to save what was written. The deployed application can be found here: https://codeandlift706.github.io/Daily-Scheduler/.


## Installation
VS Code to create and manipulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the application through the web browser. GitHub for version control and web page deployment.
Other external resources used: Dayjs library (date/time), jQuery library(for formulas), Fontawesome/Google fonts (custom text), Bootstrap (CSS).
